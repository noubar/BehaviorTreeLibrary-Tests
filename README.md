# BehaviorTreeLibrary-Tests
Demonstration Repo for the use of [RobotBT](https://github.com/noubar/RobotFramework-BehaviorTreeLibrary). (BehaviorTreeLibrary For Robot Framework)

A comprehensive test suite demonstrating the capabilities of the BehaviorTreeLibrary for Robot Framework. This repository contains practical examples of Behavior Tree (BT) implementations for test automation scenarios.

## Features üåü

In this Repo can be found

- **Three Distinct Test Levels**
  - üß© **Simple Test**: Basic BT structure demonstration. (How BT could be obsulete)
  - üß† **Complex Test**: Advanced BT with conditional nodes 
  - üåç **Real-world Test**: Practical application simulating real-world automation challenges

- **Key Demonstrations**
  - Use of [RobotBT](https://github.com/noubar/RobotFramework-BehaviorTreeLibrary)
  - Behavior Tree construction and execution
  - Node types (Sequence, Selector, Parallel)
  - Conditional logic implementation
  - Failure recovery mechanisms
  - Real-world scenario modeling


This Project uses [WPF Tesp Puzzle](https://github.com/noubar/WPF_Test_Puzzle) app to test [RobotBT](https://github.com/noubar/RobotFramework-BehaviorTreeLibrary)
